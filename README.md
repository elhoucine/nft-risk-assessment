### README: NFT Collection Risk Assessment Tool

#### 🌟 Introduction
Welcome to the **NFT Collection Risk Assessment Tool**! This handy tool is designed for anyone in the NFT space - whether you're an investor, a collector, or just NFT-curious. It's simple, user-friendly, and a great way to get a quick insight into the risk profile of various NFT collections. Let's dive into how it works!

#### 🛠 How It Works
Our tool uses a set of key metrics to assess the risk associated with NFT collections. Just input a few numbers, and voilà - you'll get a risk score from 0 (higher risk) to 100 (lower risk). Here's what we measure:

1. **Unique Holders Percentage (UHP)**: Gauges ownership distribution.
2. **Percentage of Listed Items (PLI)**: Indicates market liquidity.
3. **Volume Change (VC90)**: Looks at trading volume dynamics.
4. **Floor Price Movement (FPM90)**: Tracks the lowest price trends.
5. **Sales Change (SC90)**: Measures the change in sales activity.
6. **Market Sentiment (MS)**: Captures the overall market outlook.
7. **Team Capital (TC)**: Assesses the backing behind the collection.
8. **Community Engagement and Activity (CEA)**: Evaluates community involvement.
9. **Liquidity Gap (LG)**: Compares floor price with collection offer price.

Just fill in the numbers in our easy-to-use form and hit the "Calculate Risk" button. The tool does the rest, crunching the numbers to give you an instant risk score.
