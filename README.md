### README: NFT Collection Risk Assessment Tool

---

#### 🌟 Introduction
Welcome to the **NFT Collection Risk Assessment Tool**! This handy tool is designed for anyone in the NFT space - whether you're an investor, a collector, or just NFT-curious. It's simple, user-friendly, and a great way to get a quick insight into the risk profile of various NFT collections. Let's dive into how it works!

#### 🛠 How It Works
Our tool uses a set of key metrics to assess the risk associated with NFT collections. Just input a few numbers, and voilà - you'll get a risk score from 0 (higher risk) to 1 (lower risk). Here's what we measure:

1. **Unique Holders Percentage (UHP)** - Diversity is the spice of life... and NFTs!
2. **Percentage of Listed Items (PLI)** - Are people holding or selling?
3. **Volume Change in the Last 90 Days (VC90)** - Is the collection gaining traction?
4. **Floor Price Movement in the Last 90 Days (FPM90)** - Up? Down? Let's find out!
5. **Sales Change in the Last 90 Days (SC90)** - Are sales numbers booming?
6. **Twitter Engagement (TE)** - How's the buzz on Twitter?
7. **Market Sentiment (MS)** - What's the overall vibe?
8. **Team Capital (TC)** - Does the team have the resources to sustain?

Just fill in the numbers in our easy-to-use form and hit the "Calculate Risk" button. The tool does the rest, crunching the numbers to give you an instant risk score.
