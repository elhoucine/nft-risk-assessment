    <h4 id="-introduction">🌟 Introduction</h4>
    <p>Welcome to the <strong>NFT Collection Risk Assessment Tool</strong>! This handy tool is designed for anyone in
        the
        NFT space - whether you&#39;re an investor, a collector, or just NFT-curious. It&#39;s simple, user-friendly,
        and a
        great way to get a quick insight into the risk profile of various NFT collections. Let&#39;s dive into how it
        works!
    </p>

    <h4 id="-how-it-works">🛠 How It Works</h4>
    <p>Our tool uses a set of key metrics to assess the risk associated with NFT collections. Just input a few numbers,
        and
        voilà - you&#39;ll get a risk score from 0 (higher risk) to 100 (lower risk). Here&#39;s what we measure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Unique Holders Percentage (UHP)</strong>: Gauges ownership distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Percentage of Listed Items (PLI)</strong>: Indicates market liquidity.</li>
        <li><strong>Volume Change (VC90)</strong>: Looks at trading volume dynamics.</li>
        <li><strong>Floor Price Movement (FPM90)</strong>: Tracks the lowest price trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Sales Change (SC90)</strong>: Measures the change in sales activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Sentiment (MS)</strong>: Captures the overall market outlook.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Capital (TC)</strong>: Assesses the backing behind the collection.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Engagement and Activity (CEA)</strong>: Evaluates community involvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidity Gap (LG)</strong>: Compares floor price with collection offer price.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Just fill in the numbers in our easy-to-use form and hit the &quot;Calculate Risk&quot; button. The tool does the
        rest, crunching the numbers to give you an instant risk score.</p>
